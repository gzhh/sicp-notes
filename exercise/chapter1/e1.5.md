程序无法终止，因为 (p) 会无限调用

“fully expand and then reduce” evaluation method is known as normal-order evaluation, in contrast to the “evaluate the arguments and then apply” method that the interpreter actually uses, which is called applicative-order evaluation.

Lisp uses applicative-order evaluation, partly because of the addi- tional efficiency obtained from avoiding multiple evaluations of expres- sions such as those illustrated with (+ 5 1) and (* 5 2) above and, more significantly, because normal-order evaluation becomes much more com- plicated to deal with when we leave the realm of procedures that can be modeled by substitution.
